# Secret Teams

**Description:**

Teams are unknown and will not be displayed to everyone. You can also enable where it will show what team a player is on when they get a kill.

**Information:**

**THIS PLUGIN ALLOWS YOU TO USE BUKKIT TEAMS AND YOUR NORMAL TEAM MANAGERS**, All i'm doing is hiding the players, so you can use normal team creation, randomizers, scattering etc and it will work like normal.

I have built in kill reveal as well so when a player gets a kill their team will be revealed on tab

If you are using this and not having the kill reveal feature make sure to uncolor teams so death messages won't show them and make sure to disable all /team list commands
